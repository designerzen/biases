For instance, retrieval of one meaning for a word (e.g. the verb meaning of the word <i>sock</i>) will tend to inhibit the dominant meaning of that word (e.g. the noun meaning of <i>sock</i>).<sup id=\"cite_ref-GorfeinBrown2007SayingNo_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GorfeinBrown2007SayingNo-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> In 1995, Anderson and Spellman conducted a three-phase study using their retrieval-induced forgetting model to demonstrate unlearning as inhibition.<sup id=\"cite_ref-16\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Study phase: Participants study a list of category-exemplar pairings where some exemplars semantically similar in that they belong to another category besides the one they are explicitly paired with (e.g. Food-Cracker, Food-Strawberry, Red-Tomato, Red-Blood).</li>\n<li>Retrieval-practice phase: Participants are cued to practice remembering some of the exemplars given the category cue (e.g. Red-Bl__).</li>\n<li>Test phase: Given each category as a cue, the participant tries to recall the exemplar (e.g. Food-C__, Food-S__, Red-T__, Red-Bl__).</li></ul>\n<p>Anderson and Spellman observed that items that shared a semantic relationship with practiced information was less recallable. Using the example from above, recall of items related to practiced information, including <i>tomato</i> and <i>strawberry</i> was lower than recall for <i>cracker</i>, even though strawberry is part of a different pair. This finding suggests that associative competition by explicit category cue is not the only factor in retrieval difficulty.

One stumbling block was that repression had not been demonstrated in a research study.

The more frequently participants had tried to not think about a particular word, the less likely they were to retrieve it on a final memory test. This impairment even occurred when participants were given an \"independent probe\" test, i.e. given a similar category (insect) instead of the original cue (roach), and asked to fill in the blank on the memory test: insect-r_____. According to Anderson and Green, the fact that participants had a decreased ability to recall items they were told to forget strongly supports the existence of an inhibitory control mechanism and the idea that people have the ability to suppress unwanted memories.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bulevich2006_18-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bulevich2006-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Though Anderson &amp; Green's (2001) results have been replicated several times, a group of prominent psychology researchers using the same methodology as the original study were unable to replicate even the basic result (Bulevich, Roediger, Balota, &amp; Butler, 2006).<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bulevich2006_18-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bulevich2006-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> They determined that suppression is not a robust experimental phenomenon in the think/no-think paradigm and suggested that Anderson and Green's findings could be explained by <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Interference_theory#Retroactive_interference\" title=\"Interference theory\">retroactive interference</a>, or simply thinking about X when told to \"not think\" about Y.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bulevich2006_18-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bulevich2006-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Amnesia_for_trauma_or_abuse\">Amnesia for trauma or abuse</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/w/index.php?title=Memory_inhibition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Amnesia for trauma or abuse\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Amnesia\" title=\"Amnesia\">Amnesia</a>, the forgetting of important personal information, usually occurs because of disease or injury to the brain, while <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Psychogenic_amnesia\" title=\"Psychogenic amnesia\">Psychogenic amnesia</a>, which involves a loss of personal identity and has psychological causes, is rare.<sup id=\"cite_ref-WadeTavris2010_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-WadeTavris2010-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Nonetheless, a range of studies have concluded that at least 10% of physical and sexual abuse victims forget the abuse.<sup id=\"cite_ref-widom2_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-widom2-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-sheflin_20-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-sheflin-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-widom1_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-widom1-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Some studies claim that the rate of delayed recall of many forms of traumatic experiences (including natural disasters, kidnapping, torture and more) averages among studies at approximately 15%, with the highest rates resulting from <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse\" title=\"Child sexual abuse\">child sexual abuse</a>, military combat, and witnessing a family member murdered.<sup id=\"cite_ref-kolk1997_22-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-kolk1997-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> A 1996 interview survey of 711 women reported that forgetting and later remembering childhood sexual abuse is not uncommon; more than a quarter of the respondents who reported abuse also reported forgetting the abuse for some period of time and then recalling it on their own.

Memory inhibition theories suggest that recall of strawberry decreases when recall of tomato decreases because tomato's attributes are inhibited when red-blood is learned. MacLeod argues that inhibition does not take place, but instead is the result of confusion between similar word-pairs like food-tomato and red-strawberry that can lead to errors. This is different from tomato's attributes being inhibited.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Macleod2003_29-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Macleod2003-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> \"In most cases where inhibitory mechanisms have been offered to explain cognitive performance\", explains MacLeod, \"non-inhibitory mechanisms can accomplish the same goal (p.203)\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-Macleod2003_29-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Macleod2003-29\">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/w/index.php?title=Memory_inhibition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: See also\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Emotion_and_memory\" title=\"Emotion and memory\">Emotion and memory</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Interference_theory\" title=\"Interference theory\">Interference theory</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/w/index.php?title=Memory_inhibition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: References\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\" style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-MacLeod2007Concept-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-MacLeod2007Concept_1-0\"><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-MacLeod2007Concept_1-1\"><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-MacLeod2007Concept_1-2\"><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-MacLeod2007Concept_1-3\"><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-MacLeod2007Concept_1-4\"><sup><i><b>e</b></i></sup></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-MacLeod2007Concept_1-5\"><sup><i><b>f</b></i></sup></a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><cite id=\"CITEREFMacLeod2007\" class=\"citation book cs1\">MacLeod, C.
