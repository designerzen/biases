One-half of the word pairs were presented on the subliminal level, and the other half were presented on the supraliminal level, and then the response time was measured. As expected, the anxious and depressed groups showed an attentional bias towards negative words compared to the normal control group. On a supraliminal level, the depressed group showed greater vigilance for threat stimuli than the anxious group. However, for subliminal threat stimuli, the anxious group showed a greater vigilance, which implies an anxiety-related bias on the subconscious level.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Mogg1995_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Mogg1995-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_addictive_behaviour\">In addictive behaviour</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/w/index.php?title=Attentional_bias&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: In addictive behaviour\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Research from the past two decades has established that <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Addiction\" title=\"Addiction\">addictive behaviour</a> is strongly correlated to the attentional bias for substance-related cues, in how the latter characterizes the former.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Fielda2008_16-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Fielda2008-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> An example of this is smoking and smoking-related cues.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Begh2013_3-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Begh2013-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Research (using the Stroop paradigm) tested the effect of mixing smoking related words (cigarette, puff, and smoke) with: negative connoting words (sick, pain and guilty), positive connoting words, (safe, glad, and hopeful) and neutral connoting words (tool, shovel, and hammer). Results showed a strong correlation between a slower reaction time and the degree of negative language employed when discussing smoking. The results indicate attentional bias, suggesting the influence negative language has had on the individual attitude towards smoking.<sup id=\"cite_ref-DrobesElibero2006_17-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DrobesElibero2006-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> When asked to think of the negative consequences of smoking, as the negative language evoked underlying negative feelings toward smoking, they displayed fewer cravings than the smoker subjects who were encouraged to smoke.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Szasz2012_18-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Szasz2012-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> The experiment illustrates the influence of attentional bias on environmental smoking cues and how these could contribute to a smokers' inability to quit. As stated earlier individuals' attentional biases are influenced by <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Subliminal_stimuli\" title=\"Subliminal stimuli\">subliminal stimuli</a>, so in the smoker's case, they are more subject to substance-related stimuli such as observing other smokers or noticing ads for cigarettes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-YanJiang2009_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-YanJiang2009-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> The stimuli evoke expectancy of substance availability, which creates a further attentional bias for substance-related stimuli and induces craving for the substance.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Fielda2008_16-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Fielda2008-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Similar Stroop paradigm studies have concluded that attentional bias is not dependent on smoking itself, but rather the person who is the smoker displays attentional bias. A recent study required one group of smokers to refrain from smoking the night before and another less than an hour before. Abstinence from smoking created slower reaction time, but a smoke break between study sessions showed increased reaction time. Researchers say this shows that <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Nicotine\" title=\"Nicotine\">nicotine</a> dependence intensifies attention, but does not directly depend on smoking itself due to lack of evidence.<sup id=\"cite_ref-CanamarLondon2012_20-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-CanamarLondon2012-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> The longer reaction time suggests smokers craving a cigarette linger on smoking related words.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Field2009_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Field2009-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Smokers and smokers attempting to quit displayed the same slower reaction time for smoking related words,<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cane2008_22-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Cane2008-22\">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> which supports research that implies attentional bias is a behavioral mechanism versus a dependency mechanism, due to the fact that the smokers were slowed down by smoking related words and negative words, but not slowed down by positive and neutral words.\n</p><p>Drug addiction is also an example of attentional bias in that certain memories or objects can prompt intense cravings to one's drug of choice. It is easier for individuals who experience this to relapse and begin their drug use again, because the urges given off by that initial stimuli can prove to be too strong to curve.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> There are some ways that individuals could overcome attentional bias, and a solution is stimuli-related therapy. This type of therapy would give those struggling with addiction and relapse an opportunity to overcome the initial fear associated with a particular object. A study conducted by a group of researchers in the Netherlands found that by giving participants an opportunity to attend therapy sessions during their treatment for drug addiction, more participants remained drug free compared to those who relapsed.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_24-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> Therefore, the conclusion can be drawn that with exposure therapy, the number of patients who will leave a treatment facility and relapse decreases. The Stoop Test also showed in this study that between the control group and the treatment group the only major component of the test was time; researchers made the claim that those who received treatment reacted a lot faster to certain drug related stimuli versus those in the control group who did not.<sup id=\"cite_ref-:0_24-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:0-24\">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> This means that when experiencing attentional bias, treated addicts seemed to brush off the memories a little easier compared to those who had not received proper treatment. In other words, certain steps need to be taken in treatment facilities across the country to ensure that drug addiction no longer rises, or continues to ruin people's lives. Also, a therapy of this kind should be closely monitored and mandatory to ensure the smallest number of relapses occur after treatment.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Measurements\">Measurements</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/w/index.php?title=Attentional_bias&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Measurements\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are two different forms of attentional bias that can be measured:\n</p>\n<dl><dt>Within-subject bias</dt>\n<dd>When there is a significant difference between an anxious individuals' attention bias towards threat-related stimuli and attention bias towards <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Neutral_stimulus\" title=\"Neutral stimulus\">neutral stimuli</a> (which usually favors threat-related stimuli)<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bar-Haim2007_1-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bar-Haim2007-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Between-subject bias</dt>\n<dd>When there is a significant difference between non-anxious and anxious individuals' attention bias towards and neutral stimuli and threat-related stimuli<sup id=\"cite_ref-Bar-Haim2007_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Bar-Haim2007-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Measurement_paradigms\">Measurement paradigms</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/w/index.php?title=Attentional_bias&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Measurement paradigms\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There are four main paradigms used to measure attentional bias:<sup id=\"cite_ref-Tran2015_4-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Tran2015-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\n</p>\n<dl><dt><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Stroop_effect\" title=\"Stroop effect\">Stroop</a> paradigm</dt>\n<dd>The Stroop paradigm was the first measure of attentional bias.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Tran2015_4-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Tran2015-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> It also uses reaction time, only in this case utilizing <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Color\" title=\"Color\">colors</a>.
