Both explanations have been used for evidence of <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Conformity\" title=\"Conformity\">conformity</a> in psychological experiments.

This difference has led to research on how the behavior of voters in western United States is influenced by news about the decisions of voters in other time zones. In 1980, <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/NBC_News\" title=\"NBC News\">NBC News</a> declared <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Ronald_Reagan\" title=\"Ronald Reagan\">Ronald Reagan</a> to be the winner of the presidential race on the basis of the exit polls several hours before the voting booths closed in the west.\n</p><p>It is also said to be important in the American presidential primary elections. States all vote at different times, spread over some months, rather than all on one day. Some states (Iowa, New Hampshire) have special precedence to go early while others choose to wait until a certain date. This is often said to give undue influence to these states, a win in these early states is said to give a candidate the \"<a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/The_Big_Mo\" title=\"The Big Mo\">Big Mo</a>\" (momentum) and has propelled many candidates to win the nomination. Because of this, other states often try front loading (going as early as possible) to make their say as influential as they can. In the 2008 presidential primaries two states had all or some of their delegates banned from the convention by the central party organizations for voting too early.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Several studies have tested this theory of the bandwagon effect in political decision making. In the <a href=\"#CITEREFGoidelShields1994\">1994 study</a> of Robert K. Goidel and Todd G. Shields in <i><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/The_Journal_of_Politics\" title=\"The Journal of Politics\">The Journal of Politics</a></i>, 180 students at the University of Kentucky were randomly assigned to nine groups and were asked questions about the same set of election scenarios. About 70% of subjects received information about the expected winner.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGoidelShields1994807_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoidelShields1994807-14\">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Independents, which are those who do not vote based on the endorsement of any party and are ultimately neutral, were influenced strongly in favor of the person expected to win.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGoidelShields1994807-808_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoidelShields1994807-808-15\">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Expectations played a significant role throughout the study. It was found that independents are twice as likely to vote for the Republican candidate when the Republican is expected to win. From the results, it was also found that when the Democrat was expected to win, independent Republicans and weak Republicans were more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGoidelShields1994808_16-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoidelShields1994808-16\">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>A study by Albert Mehrabian, reported in the <i><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Journal_of_Applied_Social_Psychology\" title=\"Journal of Applied Social Psychology\">Journal of Applied Social Psychology</a></i> (<a href=\"#CITEREFMehrabian1998\">1998</a>), tested the relative importance of the bandwagon (rally around the winner) effect versus the <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Underdog_(competition)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Underdog (competition)\">underdog</a> (empathic support for those trailing) effect. Bogus poll results presented to voters prior to the 1996 Republican primary clearly showed the bandwagon effect to predominate on balance. Indeed, approximately 6% of the variance in the vote was explained in terms of the bogus polls, showing that poll results (whether accurate or inaccurate) can significantly influence election results in closely contested elections. In particular, assuming that one candidate \"is an initial favorite by a slim margin, reports of polls showing that candidate as the leader in the race will increase his or her favorable margin\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMehrabian19982128_17-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMehrabian19982128-17\">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Thus, as poll results are repeatedly reported, the bandwagon effect will tend to snowball and become a powerful aid to leading candidates.\n</p><p>During the 1992 U.S. presidential election, Vicki G. Morwitz and Carol Pluzinski conducted a study, which was published in <i>The Journal of Consumer Research</i> (<a href=\"#CITEREFMorwitzPluzinski1996\">1996</a>). At a large northeastern university, some of 214 volunteer business students were given the results of student and national polls indicating that <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Bill_Clinton\" title=\"Bill Clinton\">Bill Clinton</a> was in the lead. Others were not exposed to the results of the polls. Several students who had intended to vote for Bush changed their minds after seeing the poll results.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMorwitzPluzinski199658-64_18-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMorwitzPluzinski199658-64-18\">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>\n</p><p>Additionally, British polls have shown an increase to public exposure. Sixty-eight percent of voters had heard of the general election campaign results of the opinion poll in 1979. In 1987, this number of voters aware of the results increased to 74%.<sup id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMcAllisterStudlar1991725_19-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcAllisterStudlar1991725-19\">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> According to British studies, there is a consistent pattern of apparent bandwagon effects for the leading party.\n</p><p>In a study published in the <i><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/European_Economic_Review\" title=\"European Economic Review\">European Economic Review</a></i> (2015),<sup id=\"cite_ref-20\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Morton and co-authors, used the large number of time zones across French overseas territories, to study the bandwagon effect. Before 2002, all territories were voting on Sunday in the presidential elections. For that reason, voters in territories located to the West of mainland France (e.g. French Guyana) could observe the exit polls from mainland France before the close of their local polling booths. After 2002, a law was passed for these territories to vote on Saturday, in order to avoid this situation. The authors observed a bandwagon effect: when voters from Western territories could observe the winner in mainland France, this candidate was doing much better locally. After 2002, when voting in these territories took place before mainland France, this bandwagon voting disappeared.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_microeconomics\">In microeconomics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/w/index.php?title=Bandwagon_effect&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: In microeconomics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div role=\"note\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">See also: <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Network_effect\" title=\"Network effect\">Network effect</a> and <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Veblen_good\" title=\"Veblen good\">Veblen good</a></div>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Microeconomics\" title=\"Microeconomics\">microeconomics</a>, bandwagon effects may play out in interactions of demand and preference.<sup id=\"cite_ref-harvey_21-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-harvey-21\">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup><sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">&#91;<i><a href=\"https://wikipedia.com/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\" title=\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\"><span title=\"Quotation needed from source to verify.
