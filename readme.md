# Cognitive Biases #

An interactive chart of the human condition.

[Play with it here and learn a little about yourself and others](https://designerzen.github.io/biases/)

The actual interactive infographic is easily encapsulated and can be embedded into your own site relatively easily. Perhaps with more time I can turn it into a web component one day.

### Build your own ###

I've kept this purposely simple in keeping with the concept of biases.
Nothing fancy, no build script, no post processing, just raw files.

There is a simple web server available if you have node installed...
```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
```npm start```
